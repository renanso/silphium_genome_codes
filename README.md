## Getting Started

All the code used for data analysis and figure generation are within the folders indicated. In addition to the code, the source data is available to regenerate the results. The analyses were performed on R (v4.4.2) and bash GNU bash, version 5.1.8(1)-release (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu). Computational heavy analyses were submitted as a slurm job (v24.11.6) to the cluster.

### Prerequisites
* R (v4.4.2) Packages are indicated in the scripts.
* x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu
